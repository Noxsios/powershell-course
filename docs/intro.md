- Press the ++windows++ key, then type `PowerShell`, then hit ++enter++, this opens a new **non-elevated** _PowerShell_ instance

- <small> You may see there are some versions of PowerShell and PowerShell ISE ending with `(x86)`, these are 32-bit versions of PowerShell </small>

- If you open a new PowerShell window, but this time right-click and select `Run as Administrator`, you will open a new PowerShell window with elevated permissions
