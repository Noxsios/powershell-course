Shipped with every install of PowerShell, it includes syntax highlighting, intellisense, debugging, command search and so much more. A better IDE is VSCode with the PowerShell extension. Let me know if you want me to walk you through this install. Getting used to using the PowerShell CLI \u00b6 Command Aliases \u00b6 If you come from a Linux / Mac background, the PowerShell CLI will be very familiar. Many Bash commands are also aliased to their PowerShell counterpart ex. Bash 1 2 3 cd # change directory pwd # print working directory ls # list PowerShell 1 2 3 Set-Location Get-Locaton Get-ChildItem View Aliases 1 2 Get-Alias # To view all alias' Get-Alias \"command\" # To view the alias of a command, ex. Get-Alias rmdir Getting Help \u00b6 Like every other shell, PowerShell has an integrated helpfile system. Searching by Name 1 Get-Help * file * Retrieving by Name 1 Get-Help Get-FileHash With Examples 1 Get-Help Get-FileHash -Examples Navigating the File System \u00b6 The first thing you should master using any CLI is how to navigate directories. This transfers over to every other shell seamlessly. The only difference is that Windows uses \\ during navigation and Linux/Mac use / during navigation. First, navigate to your Window partition's root folder. Hint You will have to use a combination of cd / Set-Location and ls / Get-ChildItem Your prompt should now look like this: PS C:\\> Navigate back to your user folder, so that your prompt returns back to PS C:\\Users\\Username> Now navigate to your Desktop , -> PS C:\\Users\\Username\\Desktop> View the contents of your desktop using ls or Get-ChildItem Finally navigate back to your home folder using cd .. In PowerShell as well as Bash, . when utilized in a path argument refers to the current directory, and .. refers to the current parent directory. Fastest Route To accomplish the above using the least amount of typing, the commands are: 1 2 3 4 cd \\ cd $home cd .\\ Desktop cd .. The second command uses one of the preset PowerShell variables, $home which returns the home directory of the current logged in user.","title":"Week 1"},{"location":"intro.html#day-1","text":"","title":"Day 1"},{"location":"intro.html#environment-setup","text":"The first thing any good SysAdmin / Programmer does is setup their development environment.

Get-FileHash Docs \u00b6 We reviewed this cmdlet last week, but here is a usage example. Get-FileHash Example Right click this File , and select Save Link as... and save to your desktop. Open a new PowerShell window and navigate to your desktop with cd $HOME \\ Desktop Calculate the SHA256 hash using Get-FileHash -Path .\\ test_hash . txt -Algorithm SHA256 As you get better at knowing the order of certain command parameters you can omit the flagged names, ie -Path and -Algorithm , for within script usage, it is better to leave the statements verbose so that when you or another person return to the code it is clearer what the code is doing. Now open the file in notepad, either by double clicking on the file or using notepad . exe .\\ test_hash . txt , then delete the last character (a period) then save and close the file. To test to see if the file hash changed, we can use a simple comparison, I have calculated the before value for you. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 $oldHash = \"914523DA2E60C0AE77E21AD1EEB827F25508A6B6D984AF3E80E8D292D4ADD24B\" $newHash = Get-FileHash -Path .\\ test_hash . txt -Algorithm SHA256 $hashesEqual = $oldHash -eq $newHash . Hash if ( $hashesEqual ) { $result = \"are\" } else { $result = \"are not\" } Write-Output \"The files $result equal.\" # Should return : \"The files are not the same.\" Now re-add the period back in at the end of the file, and recalculate the above. The result should now be The files are equal. For hashing explanation - Expl Test-NetConnection Docs \u00b6 If a question asks you to check of Port 80 is open on a remote server.
